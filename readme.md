🗂️ Task Management App (C++)

A console-based Task Management Application built in C++, designed to help users organize their daily tasks, assignments, and projects efficiently.

5. 🔍 Filter Tasks:

6. ⏰ Reminders:

7. 🔐 User Authentication:
Each user has their own account to save and manage tasks separately.

8. 💾 Local Data Storage:
All data is saved in a local .txt file — no database setup needed.
